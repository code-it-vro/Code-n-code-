# Daily Coding Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I update my daily coding solutions! In this repository, I share the solutions to various coding problems that I work on every day. My goal is to continually improve my coding skills and build a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and various problem-solving techniques.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

- **Daily Coding Challenges**: Each day I solve a problem and add the solution to this repository. Problems range from algorithmic challenges, system design, web development tasks, and more.
  
- **Problem Types**: 
  - Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.)
  - Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, etc.)
  - String Manipulation
  - System Design
  - Web Development (APIs, Backend, Authentication, etc.)
  
- **Languages Used**: JavaScript, Typescript

## 💻 How to Use This Repository?

- Explore the different folders which are categorized by topics like "Arrays", "Algorithms", "Strings", etc.
- Each problem will be explained with a **brief description**, **approach**, **code**, and **complexity analysis**.
- Feel free to clone or fork the repository to practice or contribute!

## 📅 How Do I Update My Progress?

I commit solutions daily with detailed comments and explanations. I add challenges of increasing complexity to help me progress and improve over time.

## 📈 My Progress

Every day I try to solve at least one problem and update it to my repository. By keeping this repository updated, I aim to:
