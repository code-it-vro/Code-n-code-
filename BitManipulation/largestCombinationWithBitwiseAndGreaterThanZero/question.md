# Largest Combination with Bitwise AND Greater Than 0

## Problem Statement
The bitwise AND of an array `nums` is the bitwise AND of all integers in `nums`.

For example:
- For `nums = [1, 5, 3]`, the bitwise AND is `1 & 5 & 3 = 1`.
- For `nums = [7]`, the bitwise AND is `7`.

Given an array of positive integers `candidates`, evaluate the bitwise AND of every combination of numbers in `candidates`. Each number in `candidates` may only be used once in each combination.

Return the size of the largest combination of `candidates` with a bitwise AND greater than 0.

## Example 1
**Input:** `candidates = [16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** The combination `[16, 17, 62, 24]` has a bitwise AND of `16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16 > 0`.  
The size of this combination is `4`. It can be shown that no combination with a size greater than `4` has a bitwise AND greater than `0`.

## Example 2
**Input:** `candidates = [8, 8]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The largest combination `[8, 8]` has a bitwise AND of `8 & 8 = 8 > 0`.  
The size of the combination is `2`, so we return `2`.

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq \text{candidates.length} \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq \text{candidates}[i] \leq 10^7\)

## Approach and Intuition

1. **Observation:** For a bitwise AND to be greater than 0, at least one bit position (1-bit) must be set in all numbers of the combination. Therefore, a good approach would be to count how many times each bit position is set in the given `candidates` array.

2. **Bit Counting Method:**  
   - Iterate over each bit position (up to 31 bits, as values are limited to \(10^7\)), and count how many numbers in `candidates` have the `i`-th bit set.
   - For each bit position `i`, if a number has this bit set, it can potentially contribute to a combination with a non-zero AND.
   - Track the maximum count of numbers that share any particular bit position, as that count represents the largest possible combination with a bitwise AND greater than 0.

3. **Return the Result:**  
   - The answer is the maximum count obtained for any bit position, as this indicates the size of the largest combination with a bitwise AND greater than 0.

## Example Explanation

Consider `candidates = [16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14]`.  
Our task is to find the largest combination with a bitwise AND > 0.

1. **Bitwise Representation**:
   - 16 = `10000`
   - 17 = `10001`
   - 71 = `1000111`
   - 62 = `111110`
   - 12 = `1100`
   - 24 = `11000`
   - 14 = `1110`

2. **Steps**:
   - For each bit position (from 0 to 31), count how many numbers have that bit set.
   - Example: For the 4th bit (from the right, zero-indexed), `16`, `17`, `62`, and `24` have this bit set.
   - The count of numbers with the 4th bit set is 4.

3. **Result**:
   - `ans` will capture the maximum count across all bit positions.
   - In this case, the largest combination with an AND > 0 has a size of 4.

### Explanation of `(1 << i)`

- `(1 << i)` means shifting the number `1` left by `i` bits.
  This produces a number with only the `i`-th bit set to 1.

  **Examples**:
  - `1 << 0` = 1 (binary: `0001`) - checks the 0th bit.
  - `1 << 1` = 2 (binary: `0010`) - checks the 1st bit.
  - `1 << 2` = 4 (binary: `0100`) - checks the 2nd bit.

- By using `candidates[j] & (1 << i)`, we can check if the `i`-th bit in `candidates[j]` is set:
  - If the `i`-th bit in `candidates[j]` is set, `(candidates[j] & (1 << i))` will be non-zero.
  - If the `i`-th bit is not set, it will result in 0.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times 32)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `candidates`. We check each of the 32 bits for all `n` numbers.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), only using a few auxiliary variables for counting.
