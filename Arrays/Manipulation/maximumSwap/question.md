# Maximum Swap

#### You are given an integer `num`. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number. Return the maximum valued number you can get.

---

## Problem Example

**Example 1**:
- **Input**: `num = 2736`
- **Output**: `7236`
- **Explanation**: Swap the number `2` and the number `7`.

**Example 2**:
- **Input**: `num = 9973`
- **Output**: `9973`
- **Explanation**: No swap is needed as it's already the largest possible number.

---

## Problem Constraints
- `0 <= num <= 10^8`

### Intuition

The goal is to maximize the number by swapping two digits at most once. This can be done by finding the optimal pair of digits (one smaller and one larger) to swap so that the resultant number is the largest possible.

The main idea is to:
- Traverse the number from right to left, keeping track of the maximum digit (`maxEle`) encountered and its index (`maxInd`).
- As we traverse, if we find a digit smaller than the current maximum, we mark it as a candidate for swapping.

At the end of the traversal, we swap the largest rightmost digit with the smallest eligible leftmost digit.

---

### Approach

1. **Convert the number to an array of digits**:
   - We need to split the number into an array of its digits for easy manipulation.

2. **Right-to-left traversal to find the maximum digit**:
   - We traverse from the right side of the number.
   - Track the largest digit (`maxEle`) and its index (`maxInd`) as we move leftward.
   - Identify the smallest eligible digit that can be swapped with the maximum digit encountered on the right.

3. **Perform the swap**:
   - If a swap is necessary (i.e., the indices of the two digits are valid), swap them.
   - Otherwise, return the original number if no swap can yield a larger result.

4. **Reconstruct the number**:
   - After swapping, convert the array of digits back to a single number.

# Example Walkthrough

Letâ€™s go through the example `num = 98368`:

- Convert `num` to an array: `arr = [9, 8, 3, 6, 8]`
- Traverse from the right:
  - Start from index `4`: maxEle = 8 (at index 4)
  - At index `3`: `arr[3]` (6) is smaller than `maxEle`. We note that we might want to swap.
  - At index `2`: `arr[2]` (3) is also smaller than `maxEle`, and it is the best candidate for swapping.
  - At index `1`: `arr[1]` (8) is not smaller than `maxEle`, so no change here.
  - At index `0`: `arr[0]` (9) is greater than `maxEle`, so no swap needed.
  
- Now swap `arr[2]` (3) with `arr[4]` (8).
- Result after swap: `arr = [9, 8, 8, 6, 3]`
- Convert `arr` back to the number: `98863`.

# Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: We traverse the array of digits once to identify the optimal swap (where `n` is the number of digits in the number).
- **O(n)**: For converting the number to an array and then back from the array.
- Overall time complexity: **O(n)**.

# Space Complexity

- **O(n)**: We use an array of size `n` to store the digits of the number.
